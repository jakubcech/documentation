# Node software

**IOTA networks consist of interconnected nodes that run the same node software. This software gives nodes read/write access to the Tangle, allows them to validate transactions, and allows them to store transactions in their local ledgers.**

:::warning:Legacy documentation
We are developing Chrysalis, the largest update in IOTA history. If you are developing on IOTA, see [Chrysalis documentation](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/).

![Hornet](images/hornet.png)
## [Hornet](root://hornet/1.1/overview.md)
Hornet is the current node software for running nodes on any IOTA networks. This implementation will continue to be updated to include the protocol changes in Chrysalis
-------------------------

-------------------------
![Chronicle](images/Chronicle.png)
## [Chronicle](root://chronicle/1.1/overview.md)
Chronicle is an addition to the Hornet node software that allows you to store all transactions in a separate distributed database that's secure and scalable.

![GoShimmer](images/GoShimmer.png)
## [GoShimmer](https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/wiki)
GoShimmer implements a prototype of an IOTA network without the Coordinator. This network is still in development and is documented on a GitHub wiki.

![IRI](images/IRI.png)
## [IRI](root://iri/1.0/overview.md)
IRI was the original IOTA reference implementation for the IOTA Mainnet. This software is now **deprecated**. See Hornet for an up-to-date node software.
